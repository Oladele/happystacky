  In both web sites and web apps, the view (aka web page) presented by the browser, is internally made up of the same kind of code (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and multi-media assets (images, video, audio) based on the technology specification popularly known as the “Web” or “World Wide Web”. Also, in both web apps and web sites, the web browser – using the previously mentioned code and multimedia – internally creates a very important internal data structure called a Document Object Model (DOM). The browser then uses this internal DOM representation to display the web page view seen by the user. So, what’s the difference between a web app and a plain old web site ? The difference is that a web app (like all apps, by definition) can display data and perform actions that are unique to each user but websites show identical content to all users.
