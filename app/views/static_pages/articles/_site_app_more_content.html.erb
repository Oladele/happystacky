  From a user’s perspective, web apps have the following behavior, The user accesses the app by typing the app’s “URL” or “address” in a web browser URL input field (aka “address bar”). The URL is part of the HTTP standard and it looks something like “http://todolist.com”. Usually, the beginning “http://” can be omitted and it is often hidden when shown in the address bar. The user then clicks a button or hits the enter key. At this point, the app that is then displayed in the browser may look and feel like an ordinary web site. In fact, for both web sites and web apps, the view (aka web page) presented by the browser, is internally made up of the same kind of code (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and multi-media assets (images, video, audio) based on the technology specification popularly known as the “web” or “World Wide Web”. Also, in both web apps and web sites, the web browser – using the HTML, CSS, Javascript and multimedia artifacts mentioned previously – internally creates a very important internal data structure called a Document Object Model (DOM). The browser then uses this internal DOM representation to construct/display the web page view seen by the user. So, what’s the difference between a web app and a plain old web site ? The difference is that a web app (like all apps, by definition) can display data and perform actions that are unique to each user. But plain old websites like those of some some mass media outlets, most small businesses and some large businesses, show identical content to all users.
