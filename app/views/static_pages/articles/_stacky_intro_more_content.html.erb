  Most of us use tons of software services called native apps and web apps. If we go one step deeper to understand what exactly web/native apps are made of, things start getting complicated very quickly. Attempting to unpack seemingly straight-forward concepts like "client" and "server", releases tsunami-sized waves of new technology concepts (eg “client web app libraries and frameworks”) which come crashing into the pristine shores of our receptive brains. Each of these concept then explode into specific implementations. For example "Ember", "Angular", "Backbone", "Ampersand" are all implementations of "client web app libraries or frameworks". But to understand the specific implementations, there are further underlying concepts which themselves explode into further detailed implementations…and so on. Stacky Notes is a digital journal chock-full of cool diagrams and explanations which I've put together to help me (and hopefully  you) pull together all the fun and exciting internet-powered native/web app” technology stacks.
